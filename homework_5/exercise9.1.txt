Method:
Building on Exercise 9.1, first add an reverse_complement function to obtain the reversed conplement sequence by dictionary and reverse summation. Then modify the translation function. Create the amino_acid_seq list to hold the translation results for the three frame positions. Translation is performed by two nested for loops. j loop represents the three translation frame start points and i loop traverses the sequence and does translation. If codon is less than three nucleotides then no translation is performed. If 'N' appears in codon, then find its position and replace it with ATCG respectively to judge the result of translation, if it is consistent then output that amino acid, if it is inconsistent then output x.
