After that, read the xml file in gz format by gzip, use iterparse to parse the file and return event and element. determine if the tag of element is scan, if yes, then continue to determine mslevel and count. After that, look up the percursorMZ, determine whether it is between 750 and 1000, if it meets the condition, then count. Finally output the three values in turn.
