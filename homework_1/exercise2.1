For this exercise, I first set up a variable and assigned the value "ATG" to represent the start codon. Then, I used the .lower() function to convert it to lowercase letters. Afterward, I reverse indexed the content and added it together to get the reversed string. Another approach is to use reverse indexing for slicing, but since it wasn't mentioned in the lecture, I commented it out.
