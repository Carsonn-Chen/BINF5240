For this exercise, I first set up a variable to represent the start codon. Then, I used the function .lower() to convert it to lowercase letters. Afterthat, I use the reverse index to access the symbol and added it together to get the reversed string. Another approach is to use reverse indexing for slicing, but since it wasn't mentioned in the lecture, I make it comments.
