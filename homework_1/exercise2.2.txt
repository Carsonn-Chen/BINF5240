For this exercise, I first set up two variables to represent the start codon and the DNA sequence, respectively. Then, I used the .find() function to locate the position of the start codon within the sequence. Since the returned value is an index starting from 0, I added 1 to the final result. The translation frame was determined by using the modulo operator (%) to find which position it occupies within the reading frame.
