Method:

for MyDNAStuff.py:
define 6 functions to read sequence from file, check if the sequence is valid, do complement, do reversed complement, return reversed sequence in string and calculate the gc content.

for codon_table.py:
define 5 functions to read codon table from file, translate single amino_acid, check if the codon is start codon, handle with 'N' and translate whole sequence.
different from exercise 9.1. I make codons and starts dict into one dict named codon_table. And the value of this dict is another dict store the AAs and starts status.

for main:
import all functions from MyDNAStuff.py and codon_table.py and read filename from command line. Then try the use of these modules
